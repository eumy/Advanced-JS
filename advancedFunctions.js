// Compose: put two functions into one functin. 
// The output of one function is the input of another function.

// Avoiding Side Effects, functional purity (used to avoid side effects).
//What are the two elements of a pure function?
1. Deterministic --> always produces the same results given the same inputs
2. No Side Effects -->  It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a programâ€™s execution. It must only depend on its input elements.
